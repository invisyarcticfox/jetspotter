## This is just a clone of [vvanouytsel's jetspotter](https://github.com/vvanouytsel/jetspotter) script but written in typescript instead and with 10x less the amount of features and customisation.

If you do actually use this yourself, be prepared to have lots of errors if you don't remove any of the services I *do* use here, such as;
- [Discord Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for webhook notifications
- [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) for mobile notifications
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/) for data storage
