### This is just a clone of [vvanouytsel's jetspotter](https://github.com/vvanouytsel/jetspotter) script but written in typescript instead and with 10x less the amount of features and customisation.

This project depends on multiple different services, so if *for whatever reason* you want to use this too, here is a list of what I use:
- [Discord Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for webhook notifications
- [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) for mobile notifications
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/) for data storage

and if you don't want to use any of these, just **// comment out** the respective functions inside of the `index.ts` file.
